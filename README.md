## Purpose

This application installs the [forwarder channel](https://github.com/ramblecube/osc-forwarder) and patches the shop channel to work with the [shop frontend](https://github.com/openshopchannel/WSC-Web).

## Installation

You should NOT install this patcher by itself- the downloader application is needed in order for the Open Shop Channel software suite to function properly.
